                    Moving to the U.S. was more than just an academic journey—it was a life transition.
                    Adapting to a completely different environment, culture, and social dynamic wasn&#39;t always easy,
                    but it was an experience that taught me resilience, empathy, and the value of community.

                    <h2>Understanding Cultural Differences</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things I noticed was the difference in social norms. In Nepal, greetings are
                        often more formal, while here, casual small talk—even with strangers—is common. I learned to
                        embrace these nuances, observing how people interacted in class, in public spaces, and in work
                        settings. It helped me feel more confident joining conversations and participating in group activities.

                <div>
                    <h2>Improving Communication</h2>
                    <p>
                        Although I had studied in English, using it 24/7 in a fast-paced environment was a different
                        story. I started listening more carefully, watching TV shows with subtitles, and even practicing
                        conversations with classmates. Over time, my fluency and confidence grew, and I began contributing
                        more comfortably in academic discussions and team meetings.

                    <h2>Building a Support System</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the best decisions I made was reaching out and joining campus organizations and
                        student events. I connected with international students who were going through similar
                        experiences and local students who were open and curious about other cultures.
                        These relationships gave me both emotional support and practical help—from navigating
                        housing to understanding course expectations.

                <div>
                    <h2>Cooking and Food Adjustments</h2>
                    <p>
                        I missed Nepali food more than I expected, and eating out frequently wasn&#39;t always budget-friendly.
                        I began cooking traditional dishes at home, slowly stocking up on spices and ingredients.
                        It not only brought me comfort but also helped me bond with others—I&#39;d often invite friends
                        over to try momos or dal bhat. Sharing food became a beautiful way to share culture.

                <div>
                    <h2>Staying Grounded</h2>
                    <p>
                        To stay balanced, I maintained small routines—morning walks, journaling, calling family on weekends.
                        These habits helped me process the overwhelming moments and reminded me of who I was and what I came for.
                        I also practiced gratitude, recognizing how far I&#39;d come from the nervous student landing in a new land.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Adapting to life in a new country isn&#39;t about fitting in perfectly—it&#39;s about growing into the person you&#39;re becoming.
                        Through every awkward interaction and every small win, I learned that transformation comes from patience and openness.
                        Looking back, I&#39;m proud of how much I&#39;ve grown—not just as a developer, but as a person.
